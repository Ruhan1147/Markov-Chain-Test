# Markov-Chain-Test
This Python script generates random text based on a Markov chain model built from a given text file. It reads the input file (hp_sorcerer_stone.txt), cleans and preprocesses the text by removing punctuation and converting to lowercase, then extracts the first 1000 words. Using these words, it constructs a directed graph where each vertex represents a word, and edges represent transitions between consecutive words, with weights tracking how often one word follows another. The graph then computes probabilities for selecting the next word based on these weights. The compose function generates a sequence of words by randomly walking through the graph according to transition probabilities, producing text that mimics the style of the input. This approach can be adapted for different texts, such as song lyrics, by uncommenting relevant lines. The code depends on an external Graph and Vertex implementation, assumed to handle graph operations and probability calculations. Running the script prints a generated text of specified length to the console.
